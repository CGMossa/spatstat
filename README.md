## What is spatstat?

`spatstat` is an R package for analysing 
spatial point pattern data (and other kinds of spatial data).
See the website [www.spatstat.org](http://www.spatstat.org)
or read the [book](http://book.spatstat.org).
  
## Where is the official release?

For the most recent **official release** of `spatstat`,
see the [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat). 

## This page is frozen -- we are rebuilding

Normally this repository holds the development version of `spatstat`.
However, it is frozen at the moment.

The `spatstat` package has grown so large that CRAN have asked us
to split it into sub-packages. This process is almost finished.
Watch this space for further announcements!

## Installation

To install the official release of `spatstat` from CRAN, start `R` and type

```R
install.packages('spatstat')
```

and press *new issue* to start a new bug report, documentation correction
or feature request.

**Please do not post questions** on the Issues page,
because it's too clunky for correspondence.
