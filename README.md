# spatstat.core

The original `spatstat` package has been split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.core` is one of the
sub-packages. It contains all the main user-level functions that perform
statistical analysis and modelling of spatial data,
with the exception of data on linear networks.

The reorganisation of `spatstat` into a family of package is described
on the GitHub repository
[spatstat/spatstat](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).
