## Please only open an issue if you think you have identified a bug or if you have a specific feature request.
### For questions we refer to the `spatstat` tag on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spatstat/) or direct email to the authors.

If you have found a bug please delete all the template text and replace it with a minimal example to reproduce the bug. Please make sure to run the example with a recent version of `spatstat` in a fresh R session (the CRAN package `reprex` can assist you with this).
